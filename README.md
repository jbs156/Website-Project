# Website-Project
My Website Project - OPIM 668

Site construction notes:
I started with a standard html:5 core on my index.html page
I added Bootstrap CSS code to my index.html page
I added a background color (slategray) to each page using the same code that Zayn and I used during our in-class project on Juice Laundry
I used the Navbar from Bootstrap that we used on our Juice Laundry project, and renamed each page for my site
I creeated a style sheet for the font size and color of my headings on each page, referencing the stylesheets we created when we built our student sites
I added my headshot using the same code as for our student site
I sized my headshot consulting this w3 page:https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_images.asp , I also tried to make the sizing dynamic using this link
I added line breaks consulting this site: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp
I consulted this site for website layout help to place text next to my images: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/
I embedded the playlist using this site: https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-09-04/how-to-embed-spotifys-play-button/
I pulled the footer concept from our Juice Laundry project
